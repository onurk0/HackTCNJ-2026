# Linked Lit @ HackTCNJ-2026

Linked Lit is an AI-powered workspace that tranforms your PDF libraries into a connected knowledge graph.

We built this with researches in mind who may not see the initial connection between their scientifc and research articles.


**The Problem** 

- Researching a new field often times results in an endless spiral of research papers and articles that make no sense. Traditional tools, like Google Scholar, will tell you who cited whom, but there is no context about the citation, leading to work to figure out the use case of each citation.


**Our Solution**

- Linked Lit automates the boring part of reading research papers - How are these connected? 
- By extracting metadata, visualizing connections, and saving your work we are able to identify the methodologies, research fields, and generate a relationship graph all while saving your work to a stable database so you can continue to work and contribute without worry.

**Tech Stack**

  - LLM: Gemini 2.5 Flash known for its good price-to-performance and being overall well-rounded
  
  - Database: MongoDB for its easy inital startup 
  
  - Frontend: Streamlit for its responsive and data focused UI
  
  - Visualization: Pyvis for browser-based interactive graphs
  
  - Infrastructe: Hosted on a Vultr VPS for availability, scalability, and performance.
